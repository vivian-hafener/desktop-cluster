# pando

I run a cluster of HP EliteDesk 800 Gen 3's on my desk, that I call pando. I use it to test, troubleshoot, and learn - mostly about Slurm and Kubernetes. This repo contains their configuration as code.

```
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql
```
